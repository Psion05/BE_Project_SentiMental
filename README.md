# BE_Project_SentiMental-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Reviews
My Undergraduate project for Final Year Engineering.

Summary: Upon launching, GUI screen appears, screen consists of 3 options; Google Playstore, Amazon.com and Twitter.
User can input the product url for the product's reviews they want to analyze.

Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest algorithms for sentiment analysis have been tested via Python's SKlearn library.
The performance of all these algorithms was evaluated based on performance metrics. 


Almost all the algorithms performed very well (accuracy >70%), and final output uses  Support Vector Machine Classifier since it has the highest accuracy level in the 
test cases we did. Negativity and Positivity level of the reviews is calculated at the end.

Output also generates a wordcloud of positive words and negative words that occur in the scraped dataset.
